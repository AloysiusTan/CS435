# CS435: Computational Photography Spring Quarter 23/24
This repo contains implementations of computational photography assignments and projects. 

## Descriptions
### HW1: Simple Pixel Processing
This project deals with simple pixel processing operations, such as manually converting an RGB image to binary and grayscale.
It also generates a histogram of the pixel intensities and performs contrast stretching on the grayscale image.

### HW2: Resizing
This project deals with image resizing operations such as nearest neighbor sampling and bi-linear interpolation. 

### HW3: Canny Edge Detection
This project deals with the Canny Edge Detection pipeline. Implementation includes Guassian Smoothing, Gradients Computation, Non-maximum suppression and hystersis. 

### HW4: Seam Carving
This project deals with Seam Carving. Implementation includes Energy Function, Optimal Seam, Seam Removal. 

### HW5: Parametric Shapes
This project deals with Parametric Shape Detection. Implementation includes Generating Fake Data, Hough Transform (Line and Circle) and Applying Hough Transform (Circle) algorithm to actual image. 

### HW6: Classification
This project deals with Image Classification. Implementation includes K-NN on Grayscale histograms and K-NN on Gists. 

### Final Project: Scanner App
This project deals with building the Scanner pipeline. Implementation includes Edge Detection, Hough Transform, Line Selection anbd Intersections and Rectification.
