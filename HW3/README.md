## Program Features:
The program processes 2 images named 'circles1.gif' and 'image.jfif' with the following steps of the Canny Edge Detection pipeline:
	+ Gaussian Smoothin
	+ Gradients
	+ Non-maximum suppression
	+ Hystersis
This section will generate 17 images.

## Entry-point Script Name: HW3.m

## Instructions to Run:
Ensure the 'images' and 'results' folder is in the same directory as 'HW3.m'. You can then open 'HW3.m' 
and run all. All results will be overwritten and saved in a sub-folder named after the image in the 
'results' folder. Once all that is done, click run to execute the code.
