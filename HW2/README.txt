## Program Features:
The program processes 2 images named 'image1.jpg' and 'image2.jpg' with the following steps:
+ Resize the input image using Nearest Neighbor Sampling and Linear Interpolation. 
This section will generate 4 images:
	+ 2 image resized using Nearest Neighbor Sampling.
	+ 2 image resized using Linear Interpolation.

## Entry-point Script Name: HW2.m

## Instructions to Run:
Ensure the 'images' and 'results' folder is in the same directory as 'HW2.m'. You can then open 'HW2.m' 
and run all. All results will be overwritten and saved in a sub-folder named after the image in the 
'results' folder.

**NOTE: To change the desired width and height for resizing images in the HW2.m script, follow the instructions below:

1. Open the HW2.m script in your MATLAB environment.

2. Look for the small_sizes and large_sizes variables, defined in Section 1 Data Setup. The first [] is for image1 and thee second [] is for image2. 

3. Make sure the width and height are placed correctly. In MATLAB, when specifying image dimensions, the height comes first, followed by the width.

4. After making your changes, save the HW2.m script.

5. Run the script in MATLAB to apply the resizing with your new specified dimensions.
