## Program Features:
The program will generate a fake image and processes 1 image named 'circles.jif' with the following steps:
	+ Generate Fake Data
	+ Hough Transform of line with fake data
	+ Hough Transform of circle with fake data
	+ Hough Transform of circle with image for dominant circle
This section will generate 4 images.

## Entry-point Script Name: HW5.m

## Instructions to Run:
Ensure the 'images' and 'results' folder is in the same directory as 'HW5.m'. You can then open 'HW5.m' 
and run all. All results will be overwritten and saved in a sub-folder named after the image in the 
'results' folder. Once all that is done, click run to execute the code. 

If you wish to test on a new image, put that image in the 'images' folder and change the variable name on line 169 to the name of the image.
