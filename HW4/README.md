## Program Features:
The program processes 2 images named 'image1.jpg' and 'image2.jpg' with the following steps of the Seam Carving pipeline:
	+ Energy Function
	+ Optimal Seam
	+ Remove a Seam
	+ Remove all Seam
This section will generate 6 images (3 per source image) and 2 MPEG-4 video (2 per source image).

## Entry-point Script Name: HW4.m

## Instructions to Run:
Ensure the 'images' and 'results' folder is in the same directory as 'HW4.m'. You can then open 'HW4.m' 
and run all. All results will be overwritten and saved in a sub-folder named after the image in the 
'results' folder. Once all that is done, click run to execute the code. 

If you wish to test on a new image, put that image in the 'images' folder and change the variable name on line 4 to the name of the image.

Depending on the width/height of the image, the video generation may take a while. I have printed out the debug statements to indicate the progression. For reference, a video generated on a 960 x 540 image will take around 2 to 2.5 minutes.
